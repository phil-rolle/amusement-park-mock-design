## 1. Real-Time Ride Wait Time Monitoring System

### Overview
- Collects real-time ride wait times via sensors/manual input.
- Updates mobile apps and digital signage.
- Handles high-frequency updates & failures.
- Stores historical data for analytics.

### Core Components
- Data ingestion (IoT Gateway, APIs)
- Stream processing (Kafka, Kinesis)
- Time-series DB (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Cache (Redis)
- Notification system
- Visualization dashboards
- Monitoring & alerting

### Mock Q&A
**Q:** How to handle sudden surges in data?  
**A:** Autoscale ingestion layer; use stream processing with backpressure; shard topic partitions.

**Q:** How do you ensure data accuracy?  
**A:** Validate inputs at ingestion; cross-check with historical data; discard outliers.

## 2. Park Visitor Location Tracking & Analytics

### Overview
- Track visitor location anonymously using Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS.
- Generate heatmaps for crowd control.
- Trigger alerts on overcrowding.
- Ensure privacy compliance.

### Core Components
- Data collectors (APs, beacons)
- Data pipeline (Kafka, MQTT)
- Geospatial DB (PostGIS, Cassandra with geo extensions)
- Real-time analytics engine
- Alerting & dashboarding
- Data anonymization & compliance modules

### Mock Q&A
**Q:** How do you anonymize visitor data?  
**A:** Hash MAC addresses, avoid PII storage, aggregate data before analysis.

**Q:** How to minimize latency in alerts?  
**A:** Use stream processing, keep critical logic in-memory, push alerts asynchronously.

## 3. Dynamic Pricing System for Tickets

### Overview
- Adjust ticket prices in real-time based on demand, weather, events.
- Instant propagation to booking system.
- Rollback support.

### Core Components
- Pricing engine (rules-based + ML models)
- Configuration service
- API for pricing queries
- Cache for hot pricing data
- Audit logs & rollback mechanisms
- Monitoring of pricing impact

### Mock Q&A
**Q:** How to safely roll back price changes?  
**A:** Use versioned pricing configs, implement canary rollouts, monitor KPIs closely.

**Q:** How to prevent stale pricing info?  
**A:** TTL-based cache invalidation, push updates via pub/sub systems.

## 4. Ride Maintenance & Incident Reporting System

### Overview
- Capture incidents via staff or sensors.
- Schedule maintenance automatically.
- Notify teams & track history.
- Integrate inventory for parts.

### Core Components
- Incident reporting app/API
- Workflow engine (e.g., Camunda, Step Functions)
- Scheduling & calendar DB
- Notification system (email/SMS)
- Inventory management integration
- Analytics dashboard

### Mock Q&A
**Q:** How to ensure critical incidents are prioritized?  
**A:** Use severity levels, SLA timers, escalate overdue incidents.

**Q:** How to handle sensor failure data?  
**A:** Use heartbeats; alert on missing data; fallback to manual reporting.

## 5. Visitor Feedback & Sentiment Analysis Platform

### Overview
- Collect text/voice feedback.
- ML-based sentiment classification.
- Dashboards & alerting on negative trends.

### Core Components
- Feedback collection (web, kiosks, apps)
- NLP pipeline (speech-to-text, sentiment analysis)
- Data storage (NoSQL/DB)
- Alerting on negative spikes
- Reporting dashboards
- Feedback moderation tools

### Mock Q&A
**Q:** How to improve sentiment model accuracy?  
**A:** Train with domain-specific data; use feedback loop; combine text & voice inputs.

**Q:** How to handle abusive content?  
**A:** Use automated filtering, human moderation, and rate limiting.

# Summary Tips
- Always highlight **scalability, availability, security, and cost** in your answers.
- Start with a simple design, then **iterate** based on interviewersâ€™ follow-ups.
- Show knowledge of **cloud-native tools** (AWS/GCP/Azure) if relevant.
- Discuss **monitoring/alerting** and **failure recovery** proactively.
